* This is a X11 program to configure the system...
    Functions:
	1. Add, edit or remove users
	2. Add, edit or remove groups
	3. Add or remove user to/from groups
	4. Change user or group passwords

* To install in '/usr/local' just type 'make' or 'make install'.
  The main binary is installed in '/usr/local/sbin/', and the
  libraries in '/usr/local/lib/xadmin/'. The config
  files that is created if you choose to configure it differently
  than originaly is stored in '/etc/xadmin'.

* To uninstall program, just type 'make unintall'.

* If you are unsure if this program is unsafe, then just copy
  the following files from '/etc': passwd, group, named.boot, fstab
  and shadow if you have that, to the source tree's 'etc' directory...
  That way you can try it out, without risking the real files. Just
  start it in the source tree like this: './xadmin'.

* If you really whant to play it safe, you can edit the file 'xedit-users',
  the line saying '$play_it_safe   = 0;' TO: '$play_it_safe   = 1;' that
  way it will not overwrite the old files that you might have...

* If you get the following error when starting 'xadmin':
  ------ snipp here ------
  Can't find loadable object for module Tk in @INC (
    ( /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00307
      /usr/lib/perl5
      /usr/local/lib/site_perl/i386-linux
      /usr/local/lib/site_perl
      .) at xadmin line 34
  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at xadmin line 34.
  ------ snipp here ------
  then enter the following lines:
    cd /usr/lib/perl5/i386-linux/5.00307/auto
    ln -s ../../../i486-linux/5.003/auto/Tk

  The problem here is that perl can not find the perltk stuff in the right
  directory...

* If you have any bugg reports, any questions etc, please feel free to
  send me an email at turbo@tripnet.se, or turbo@debian.org.
